## System Overview

Quantum-HDR (Q-HDR) enables quantum superposition-based decision pathway exploration, allowing parallel exploration of multiple decision states and optimal outcome prediction through quantum probability mechanics.

## Key Innovations

* **Quantum Superposition:** Maintain multiple decision states simultaneously
* **Probability Exploration:** Navigate decision spaces with quantum mechanics
* **Future State Prediction:** Simulate outcomes before commitment
* **Optimal Path Selection:** AI-driven best pathway identification

## Core Features

### Superposition States

Q-HDR maintains 16+ superposition states per decision node, enabling comprehensive decision space exploration.

### Decision Tree Generation

Automatic generation of multi-dimensional decision trees with probability weighting and outcome prediction.

### Integration

* **N-HDR:** Consciousness-aware decision making
* **O-HDR:** Knowledge-informed probability assessment
* **NS-HDR:** Swarm-accelerated exploration

## API Reference

```javascript
const quantumState = await quantumHDR.createSuperposition({
  states: [option1, option2, option3],
  probabilities: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
});

const optimal = await quantumHDR.findOptimalPath(quantumState);
```
