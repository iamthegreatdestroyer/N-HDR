**Copyright © 2025 Stephen Bilodeau - Patent Pending - All Rights Reserved**

## System Overview

Void-Blade HDR (VB-HDR) provides quantum-secured hypersonic protection with intelligent selective targeting, ensuring maximum security for all HDR Empire Framework components.

## Key Innovations

* **Quantum Security:** Quantum encryption and protection mechanisms
* **Hypersonic Response:** Sub-millisecond threat response times
* **Intelligent Targeting:** AI-driven selective threat assessment
* **Multi-Layered Protection:** 9 security levels with auto-scaling

## Core Features

### Security Zones

Create isolated security zones with configurable protection levels and automatic scaling based on threat assessment.

### Threat Assessment

Real-time threat detection and intelligent classification with automated response coordination.

### Quantum Encryption

AES-256-GCM with quantum key distribution for unbreakable encryption.

### Selective Targeting

Intelligent threat prioritization and response allocation based on risk assessment.

## Security Levels

* **Level 1-3:** Basic protection for public systems
* **Level 4-6:** Enhanced protection for sensitive systems
* **Level 7-9:** Maximum protection for critical systems

## API Reference

```javascript
const zone = await voidBladeHDR.createSecurityZone({
  name: 'critical-systems',
  level: 'maximum',
  autoScale: true
});

const protected = await voidBladeHDR.protect(resource, {
  zoneId: zone.id,
  quantumSecurity: true
});
```

## Integration
